        Every few months someone asks me what font I'm using. To keep up with
        this incredible demand, I've written this web page. Enjoy! ðŸ™Œ

      <h2>Arch Linux</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It
          Simple
        </summary>
        <p>
          The biggest benefits of Arch Linux is that it encourages you to
          actually learn Linux and it gives you full control of your computer. I
          initially switched to Ubuntu Linux from macOS after my first year of
          professional web development experience. As a web developer, the
          product of my work always runs on Linux servers, and I knew that
          switching to Linux would help me improve my Linux skills. After half a
          year on Ubuntu, and a brief stint on Manjaro Linux, I made the switch
          to Arch Linux. Arch Linux provides you very little out of the box. No
          browser. No file manager. No desktop environment. Not even the `sudo`
          command. Arch has made me learn so much more about Linux and the
          command line than I would have if I stayed on Ubuntu or macOS.

      <h2>ThinkPad T580</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>A laptop made by Lenovo</summary>
        <p>
          When it came time to replace my 2013 Macbook Pro, I knew I wouldn't be
          buying another Mac. The Macs on the market were expensive, hard to
          repair, and seemed to be getting less usable with every iteration.
          Instead I got a ThinkPad and threw Linux on it. My ThinkPad has a nice
          UHD screen, really bad speakers, a decent keyboard (for a laptop), and
          enough ports for everything I need to plug in. I used to love my
          Macbook, but now I can't imagine going back. The ThinkPad is much
          faster than the equivalently priced Mac, and Linux runs perfectly on
          it.

      <h2>Colemak Mod DH</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts,
          designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English
        </summary>
        <p>
          I explained why I switched to Colemak on my blog. I also explained
          some of the downsides.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly had a crisis of faith and went back to QWERTY. I lasted two
          weeks and was back on Colemak but now using the Mod DH variation. It's
          near perfect.

      <h2>Neovim</h2>

        <summary>
          Neovim is a rewrite of Vim, built for users who want the good parts of
          Vim, and more.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Neovim is my editor of choice. I use it for everything I can. I've
          used Intellij, Sublime Text, Atom, and VSCode in the past. They all
          have their merits. But no editor has made me as productive as Neovim.
          It's fast and it allows me to be fast.

          awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window
          manager for X.
        </summary>
        <p>
          I don't use a full desktop environment. I try to do almost everything
          from the command line. But I do need to run a graphical environment
          and I need a window manager. For a while I used i3, and I liked it. I
          used bspwm for a while and liked that too. Now I'm using awesome. I
          like that it's configured in Lua.

      <h2>Roboto Mono</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like
          the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for
          readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading
          environments. While the monospaced version is related to its variable
          width cousin, it doesnâ€™t hesitate to change forms to better fit the
          constraints of a monospaced environment.
        </summary>
        <p>
          I've used a lot of terminal fonts. Roboto is very clean and easy to
          read.

          Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible
          defaults, but allows for extensive configuration.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Alacritty is an easy to configure terminal emulator. I go back and
          forth between it and Kitty. They are about the same for me.

        <summary>A USB microphone</summary>
        <p>
          I bought a Blue Yeti when I started working from home because I knew
          that I'd be doing a lot more video conferencing. It's pretty good, and
          was very easy to set up. However, it picks up a lot of ambient sound.
          In the future I'll probably switch to something else.

      <h2>mycli</h2>

        <summary>
          MyCLI is a command line interface for MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona with
          auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
        </summary>
        <p>
          I've tried a number of database clients. On the Mac, I used Sequel
          Pro. It was simple and clean. When I switched to Linux, I used DBeaver
          for quite a while. DBeaver has a ton of functionality, but it was slow
          to load and more complicated than I needed. Eventually I switched to
          mycli and I love it. It's very fast, gives useful highlighting, and
          has made me a much better SQL user. I have recommended it to others,
          but so far no takers.
