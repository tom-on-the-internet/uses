        Every few months someone asks me what font I'm using. To keep up with
        this incredible demand, I've written this web page. Enjoy! ðŸ™Œ

      <h2>Arch Linux</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It
          Simple
        </summary>
        <p>
          The biggest benefits of Arch Linux is that it encourages you to
          actually learn Linux and it gives you full control of your computer. I
          initially switched to Ubuntu Linux from macOS after my first year of
          professional web development experience. As a web developer, the
          product of my work always runs on Linux servers, and I knew that
          switching to Linux would help me improve my Linux skills. After half a
          year on Ubuntu, and a brief stint on Manjaro Linux, I made the switch
          to Arch Linux. Arch Linux provides you very little out of the box. No
          browser. No file manager. No desktop environment. Not even the `sudo`
          command. Arch has made me learn so much more about Linux and the
          command line than I would have if I stayed on Ubuntu or macOS.

      <h2>ThinkPad T580</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>A laptop made by Lenovo</summary>
        <p>
          When it came time to replace my 2013 Macbook Pro, I knew I wouldn't be
          buying another Mac. The Macs on the market were expensive, hard to
          repair, and seemed to be getting less usable with every iteration.
          Instead I got a ThinkPad and threw Linux on it. My ThinkPad has a nice
          UHD screen, really bad speakers, a decent keyboard (for a laptop), and
          enough ports for everything I need to plug in. I used to love my
          Macbook, but now I can't imagine going back. The ThinkPad is much
          faster than the equivalently priced Mac, and Linux runs perfectly on
          it.

      <h2>Colemak Mod DH</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts,
          designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English
        </summary>
        <p>
          I explained why I switched to Colemak on my blog. I also explained
          some of the downsides.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly had a crisis of faith and went back to QWERTY. I lasted two
          weeks and was back on Colemak but now using the Mod DH variation. It's
          near perfect.

      <h2>Neovim</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Neovim is a rewrite of Vim, built for users who want the good parts of
          Vim, and more.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Neovim is my editor of choice. I use it for everything I can. I've
          used Intellij, Sublime Text, Atom, and VSCode in the past. They all
          have their merits. But no editor has made me as productive as Neovim.
          It's fast and it allows me to be fast.

      <h2>bspwm</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves
          of a full binary tree
        </summary>
        <p>
          I don't use a full desktop environment. I try to do almost everything
          from the command line. But I do need to run a graphical environment
          and I need a window manager. For a while I used i3, and I liked it.
          When I switched to Arch Linux, I decided to choose a window manager
          that was more minimal than i3. bspwm does not include a hotkey daemon,
          so I had to install one. bspwm does not include an application
          launcher, so I had to install one. I like the simplicity of the bspwm
          configuration file. All in all, I'm still learning to use bspwm.

          My font du jour is Hermit. Hermit is a cool looking font. It looks
          retro and playful, but clean.

        <p>
          I was on Firefox Developer Edition for a while, but it seems like
          Firefox is dying. Chrome works well and syncs with my phone. So long
          Firefox.

      <h2>nightfly</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          nightfly is a dark GUI color scheme for Vim and Neovim heavily
          inspired by Sarah Drasner's Night Owl theme
        </summary>
        <p>
          I use nightfly because it's easy on the eyes, it looks great, and it
          was easy to make my terminal theme match my Vim theme.

        <p>
          Kitty is an easy to configure terminal emulator. I go back and forth
          between it and Alacritty. They are about the same for me.

      <h2>Blue Yeti</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>A USB microphone</summary>
        <p>
          I bought a Blue Yeti when I started working from home because I knew
          that I'd be doing a lot more video conferencing. It's pretty good, and
          was very easy to set up. However, it picks up a lot of ambient sound.
          In the future I'll probably switch to something else.

      <h2>mycli</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>
          MyCLI is a command line interface for MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona with
          auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
        </summary>
        <p>
          I've tried a number of database clients. On the Mac, I used Sequel
          Pro. It was simple and clean. When I switched to Linux, I used DBeaver
          for quite a while. DBeaver has a ton of functionality, but it was slow
          to load and more complicated than I needed. Eventually I switched to
          mycli and I love it. It's very fast, gives useful highlighting, and
          has made me a much better SQL user. I have recommended it to others,
          but so far no takers.
